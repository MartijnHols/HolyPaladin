## About

Replaces [Avenging Wrath](../../AvengingWrath.md), does **not** gain any of its original benefits. Increases the damage done by [Crusader Strike](../../CrusaderStrike.md), [Judgment](../../Judgment.md) and auto-attacks by 30%. The cooldown recovery rate of [Crusader Strike](../../CrusaderStrike.md) and [Judgment](../../Judgment.md) is increased by 30%. This happens in-game by making every 1 second of cooldown elapse in 0.7 seconds (the cooldown ticks are quicker). The CDR also applies to abilities already on cooldown when AC is cast.

[Crusader Strike](../../CrusaderStrike.md) and [Judgment](../../Judgment.md) heal up to 3 injured allies for 250% of the damage dealt with those abilities. This healing is also replicated to beacons.

Target selection is **not** a [smart heal](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Smart_spell). It picks up to 3 injured allies at random, regardless of the health they're missing. If there are fewer than 3 injured players, it will randomly select full health players. The max range of the heals is 40 yards, which is unaffected by [Rule of Law](../30/RuleOfLaw.md).

You can use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rkdTSbG3k3diyh5kak5ljS0Be4mrZbaACM2w2ImCxvM/edit#gid=0) to play around with different Haste values and see how Avenging Crusader interacts with [Crusader's Might](../15/CrusadersMight.md). In most cases [Crusader's Might](../15/CrusadersMight.md) will at best get you 1 more [Holy Shock](../../HolyShock.md) or [Light of Dawn](../../HolyShock.md) cast.

The two different spells showing in logs separate normal hits and crits. You can identify them by the spell having crit 100% of the time, or never.

## Interactions

| Effect | Applicable | Explanation |
| ------ | :--------: | ----------- |
| Beacon transfers | 100% | Single target efficiency |
| Intellect | ✔ | CS/J scale with Intellect via the AP modifier (104% as of 24 July 2018) |
| Critical Strike | ✔ | If CS/J crit, the heal also [increases](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4565223/39959723-1ed3419e-5616-11e8-8986-6d66202f691f.png) |
| Haste | ✔ | Static cooldown, but Haste allows you to cast more spells that transfer |
| Mastery | ❌ | CS/J and AC's heal do not scale with Mastery |
| Versatility | ✔ | CS/J scale with Versatility |
| Healing increasers | ✔ | **NOTE:** Ilterendi does **not** boost Judgment healing because the buff is ineffective until after the healing has gone out. |

Note that the transfer rates in logs might appear inconsistent. This is due to interactions with enemy damage taken (de)buffs and healing increases. Damage gained or lost from enemy damage taken (de)buffs does not transfer through Avenging Crusader. At the same time the healing also gets boosted by healing increases such as from Ilterendi. This combination makes for some wierd and hard to pinpoint numbers:

- 238% transfer = damage was boosted by a 5% damage taken class buff and that was compensated in the transfer
- 250% = boss has no damage taken bonus buffs
- 274% = adjust for 5% damage taken class buff & add 15% healing from Ilterendi (ring legendary)

There are other possibilities based on the healing taken buffs players have.

## Bugs

- Swapping to Avenging Crusader while [Avenging Wrath](../../AvengingWrath.md) is on cooldown, allows you to cast AC right away #1
