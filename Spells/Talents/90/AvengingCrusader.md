## About

Replaces [Avenging Wrath](../../AvengingWrath.md), does not gain any of its base buffs.

Increases the damage done by [Crusader Strike](../../CrusaderStrike.md), [Judgment](../../Judgment.md) and auto-attacks by 30%.

The cooldown recovery rate of [Crusader Strike](../../CrusaderStrike.md) and [Judgment](../../Judgment.md) is increased by 30%. This happens in-game by making every 1 second of cooldown elapse in 0.7 seconds (the cooldown ticks are quicker). The CDR also applies to abilities already on cooldown when AC is cast.

[Crusader Strike](../../CrusaderStrike.md) and [Judgment](../../Judgment.md) heal up to 3 injured allies for 175% of the damage dealt with those abilities. Target selection is **not** a [smart heal](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Smart_spell). It picks up to 3 injured allies at random, regardless of the health they're missing. If there are fewer than 3 injured players, it will randomly select full health players. The max range of the heals is 40 yards, which is unaffected by [Rule of Law](../30/RuleOfLaw.md).
