# Light's Hammer

![Tooltip]()

Tier 15 talent | Heal | AoE | Targeted (ground) | GCD | 5,600 mana

## About

Throw Light's Hammer somewhere where the raid is going to be stacked for the next 14 seconds to heal up to 6 targets during this time.

Strong if stacked in the same location during periods of the fight, weak if you have to move and/or spread a lot.

Compared to [Bestow Faith](./BestowFaith.md) this requires much fewer GCDs, but it will lead to more mana consumption.
