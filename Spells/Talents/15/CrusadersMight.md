## About

Offers an alternative play-style where you hit the boss regularly while healing to gain more [Holy Shock](../HolyShock.md)s and [Light of Dawn](../LightOfDawn.md).

## Interactions

For all spells that have their CD scale with Haste, when your Haste changes while a CD is running, their CD will update. The CDR applied by CM however is static.
