## About

Increases your damage, healing and critical strike chance by 30%* for a few seconds.

See also tier 90: [Sanctified Wrath](Talents/90/SanctifiedWrath.md), [Avenging Crusader](Talents/90/AvengingCrusader.md) and [Awakening](Talents/90/Awakening.md).

\* The tooltip on Wowhead/WoWDB will show only a 20% bonus because this is the default for the class, but the Holy Paladin spec gains another 10% from [the spec passive](https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/137029).

## Changes since Legion

- Put on the GCD

## Bugs

- Swapping to Avenging Crusader while Avenging Wrath is on cooldown, allows you to cast AC right away #1
- The critical strike gain is not shown in the character pane.
- [Sanctified Wrath](Talents/90/SanctifiedWrath.md) does not currently work at all.
