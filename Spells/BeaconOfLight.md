## About

Places a beacon on a target, transfering a percentage of your **raw healing done** to this target. Healing your [Beacon of Light](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=53563) target directly with [Flash of Light](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19750) or [Holy Light](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=82326) will refund some of it's mana cost, but is generally less efficient due to missing out on the beacon transfer healing.
