## About

Places a beacon on a target, transfering a percentage of your **raw healing done** to this target. Healing your [Beacon of Light](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=53563) target directly with [Flash of Light](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=19750) or [Holy Light](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=82326) will not also transfer healing to that same target's beacon, but will instead refund some of its mana cost. It is generally less efficient to directly heal a beacon target due to missing out on the beacon transfer healing.

AoE spells transfer healing to beacons at a reduced 50% efficiency. The exact efficiency amounts are:

| Spell | Efficiency |
| ----- | ---------: |
| Holy Shock | 100% |
| Light of Dawn | 50% |
| Holy Light | 100% |
| Flash of Light | 100% |
| Holy Prism (@enemy) | 50% |
| Holy Prism (direct healing friendly) | 100% |
| Light's Hammer | 50% |
| Tyr's Deliverance | 100% |
| Bestow Faith | 100% |
| Light of the Martyr (Maraad's) | 100% |
| Avenging Crusader | 100% |
