## About

Heals up to 5 injured allies in a frontal cone for a medium amount.

- Can hit pets.
- There is a 360 degree radius of 5 yards around the player in addition to the 90 degree cone of 15 yards in front of the player. This is increased by 50% by [Rule of Law](Talents/30/RuleOfLaw.md).
- As long as any part of a players' hitbox is inside the cone, they're eligible for a heal
